# Topology-Optimization-of-Hierarchial-Structures
###### This repository contains all the codes and files developed for a research project on Topology Optimization done under Department of Aerospace Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay
The initial part of the project contains numerical computations on numerical techniques like the finite difference, gradient descent, forward and backward euler, Constrained Optimization using Lagrange Multipliers finite element method and plotting results on python, matplotlib and GNUPlot.
